	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
<p>Time Complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the string representing the input. The goal in all of this is to develop efficient algorithms.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of memory used by an algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result. Sometime Auxiliary Space is confused with Space Complexity. But Auxiliary Space is the extra space or the temporary space used by the algorithm during its execution. An algorithm generally requires space for following components: Instruction Space, Data Space, Environmental Stack. For example, linear space complexity O(n) means that the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
